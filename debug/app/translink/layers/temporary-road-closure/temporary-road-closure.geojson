The bridge replacement project involves lane closures and a reduction of the bridge load rating to maximum 20,000 kg gross vehicle weight (GVW), hence requiring heavy trucks to detour around the bridge. Detour route suggestions and additional information about the project are available on the City of North Vancouverâ€™s website." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.09415, 49.32099 ] } }
