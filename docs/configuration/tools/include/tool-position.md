## Position Property
`"position"`: `String`

Some tools show a button that activates the tool, and that button must be positioned in one of the tool button containers.
The tool button containers are: `toolbar`, `list-menu`, and `shortcut-menu`.
This property's value is the name of the container, or `null` to prevent button from appearing.
The tool button container must itself be enabled.
